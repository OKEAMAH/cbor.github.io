        <h2>Specification</h2>
        <p class='lead'>
          CBOR is specified in an Internet Standard RFC.
          RFCs that serve as Internet Standards are generated by the
          <a href='https://ietf.org'>IETF</a>
          based on an extensive technical review and quality control process.  These are meant to last.

            in 2013, a new edition of the specification has become available in 2020:
            describing the same format, but with more explanation of topics
            that had arisen since the first RFC.

          <p>
            CBOR has been designed to be extensible by enabling third parties to define Tags.
            Immediately after CBOR was published, extensions started to be documented.
            Those that are completed are collected in an
            <a href='https://iana.org'>IANA</a>
            registry to ensure specifications are available and that they don't stumble over each other.

            Binary-enabled serialization is useful for cryptography.
            CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) provides a standard way to exchange authenticated,
            integrity protected, and confidentiality protected objects using CBOR.

            Based on COSE, the CBOR Web Token (CWT) is for CBOR what the JSON Web Token (JWT) is for JSON:
            A compact means of representing claims to be securely conveyed between two parties.

            The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) provides a

            structures.
            This is used in specifications and other design documents for
            describing the structures that one party is meant to send to another,
            enabling informed discussion, input validation, and even code
            generation.
